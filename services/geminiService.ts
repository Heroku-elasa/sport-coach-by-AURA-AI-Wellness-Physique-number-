    3.  Use the image to inform your analysis on skin tone, texture, visible concerns (e.g., redness, blemishes, wrinkles), and face shape. Integrate these visual observations with the user's text symptoms to provide a more accurate and personalized result.

    2.  **General Recommendations**: Provide 3-4 high-level, actionable recommendations covering topics like hydration, sleep, consistency, or progressive overload.
    3.  **Workout Plan**:
        - Create a logical weekly split based on the user's goal and available days (e.g., Full Body, Upper/Lower, PPL). Name the split.
        - For each of the ${userData.daysPerWeek} days, create a workout.
        - Each workout day must have a clear 'focus' (e.g., "Push Day - Chest, Shoulders, Triceps").
        - List 5-7 appropriate 'exercises' for each workout day.
        - For each exercise, provide a realistic 'sets', 'reps', and 'rest' range (e.g., "3-4" sets, "8-12" reps, "60s" rest).
    4.  **Diet Plan**:
        - Calculate and provide a target for 'dailyCalories'. Base this on the user's stats, goal (e.g., slight surplus for muscle gain, slight deficit for fat loss), and an assumed activity level.
        - Calculate and provide a gram targets for 'macros' (protein, carbs, fat). A common starting point is ~1.6-2.2g protein per kg bodyweight.
        - Provide 3-4 'sampleMeals' (e.g., Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, Snack) with a brief description of a suitable meal for each.

    Instructions:
    - The language for all user-facing text content within the JSON, like country names or source names, MUST be '${language}'.
    - For 'topCountries', provide 5 countries. Include a relevant emoji for each country's flag. The countries should be diverse, including some from the Middle East like Iran or UAE.
    - For 'trafficSources' and 'deviceBreakdown', ensure the percentages for each category add up to 100.
    - For 'topPages', use plausible page paths from the AURA AI site like '/skin-consultation', '/fitness-assessment', '/blog/anti-aging-serums'.
    
    The entire response must be a single, valid JSON object that strictly adheres to the provided schema.
