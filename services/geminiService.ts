        -   Provide 2-3 actionable 'recommendations' to improve posture (e.g., "Incorporate chin tuck exercises to strengthen neck extensors," "Focus on scapular retraction exercises like band pull-aparts," "Be mindful of standing tall with shoulders back and down.").
        -   If no photo is provided or the photo is not suitable for posture analysis (e.g., not a full-body standing pose), set the 'postureAnalysis' field to null.
    3.  **General Recommendations**: Provide 3-4 high-level, actionable recommendations covering topics like hydration, sleep, consistency, or progressive overload.
    4.  **Workout Plan**:
        - Create a logical weekly split based on the user's goal and available days (e.g., Full Body, Upper/Lower, PPL). Name the split.
        - For each of the ${userData.daysPerWeek} days, create a workout.

        - List 5-7 appropriate 'exercises' for each workout day.
        - For each exercise, provide a realistic 'sets', 'reps', and 'rest' range (e.g., "3-4" sets, "8-12" reps, "60s" rest).
    5.  **Diet Plan**:
        - Calculate and provide a target for 'dailyCalories'. Base this on the user's stats, goal (e.g., slight surplus for muscle gain, slight deficit for fat loss), and an assumed activity level.
        - Calculate and provide a gram targets for 'macros' (protein, carbs, fat). A common starting point is ~1.6-2.2g protein per kg bodyweight.
